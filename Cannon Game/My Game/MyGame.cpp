/// \mainpage Box2D Cannon Game
///
/// The aim of the Cannon Game is to use the cannon to knock down a tower of crates
/// in less than 60 seconds. If the cannon overheats, the cannon explodes and
/// you lose. If time runs out, you lose anyway. You have to get all of the crates
/// below a line approximately at the horizon to win.
///
/// Use the space bar to fire the cannon, the left and right arrow keys to 
/// start it moving to the left or right (which it will continue to do),
/// the up and down arrow keys to elevate the cannon barrel, the Enter key to restart
/// the game, and the ESC key to quit.
///
/// Changes to the code since the book was published include the following.
/// The Visual Studio Solution and Projects have been upgraded to Visual Studio 2013.
/// The Solution has now been broken up into multiple Projects.
/// TinyXML has been upgraded from the original to TinyXML 2.
/// The graphics and sound code in the Engine project was upgraded to DirectX 11.2 and
/// DirectXTK with the assistance of Brandon Nelson. These changes naturally rippled
/// through this project, with the most notable effects being the replacement of
/// D3DX declarations by the corresponding DirectXTK declarations (the most frequently
/// used of which are probably D3DXVECTOR3 and D3DXVECTOR2, which were replaced by Vector3
/// and Vector2, respectively).
