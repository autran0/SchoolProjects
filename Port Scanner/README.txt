Running the Port Scanner (Linux)


In the terminal, run the command:
> python portscanner.py [website]

where [website] is the website you want to scan the ports for. This scans the most common ports.


To run a specified scope of ports, run:
> python portscanner.py [website] [lowest port #] [highest port #]

This will scan the all ports in the range given, exclusively.
